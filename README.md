# @diffdeckai/playwright-reporter

A [Playwright](https://playwright.dev) reporter that uploads each test's **video recording** — together with a **per-step timeline** — to [DiffDeck](https://diffdeck.ai). DiffDeck hosts the videos and renders the step timeline over them so you can scrub a failing run step by step.

The reporter does not run or change your tests. It hooks into Playwright's reporting lifecycle: on each test end it finds the recorded video attachment, packages the step timing it captured via `onStepBegin`/`onStepEnd`, and `POST`s both to your DiffDeck repository.

## Install

```bash
npm install --save-dev @diffdeckai/playwright-reporter
```

`@playwright/test` is a peer dependency (Playwright `>=1.30`).

## Configure

Add the reporter to `playwright.config.ts` and make sure Playwright is **recording video** (the reporter has nothing to upload otherwise):

```ts
import { defineConfig } from "@playwright/test";

export default defineConfig({
  use: {
    video: "on", // or "retain-on-failure"
  },
  reporter: [
    ["list"],
    ["@diffdeckai/playwright-reporter"],
  ],
});
```

That's the whole integration. The **only** thing you must supply is the project token
via `DIFFDECK_TOKEN` (see below) — `host` is optional and defaults to
`https://diffdeck.ai` (production), and branch/commit auto-resolve from CI env vars.
Point at a self-hosted / non-default instance only if you need to:

```ts
reporter: [["list"], ["@diffdeckai/playwright-reporter", { host: "https://diffdeck.example" }]],
```

### Options

All options are optional and fall back to environment variables.

| Option           | Type       | Env fallback                                                                       | Default              | Description                                                                                  |
| ---------------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `host`           | `string`   | `DIFFDECK_HOST`                                                                    | `https://diffdeck.ai` | DiffDeck base URL. Recordings are POSTed to `<host>/api/products/ui-review/recordings`.       |
| `token`          | `string`   | `DIFFDECK_TOKEN`                                                                   | —                    | Per-repo project token, sent as the `X-UI-Review-Token` header. **Required** to upload.       |
| `branch`         | `string`   | `DIFFDECK_BRANCH`, `GITHUB_HEAD_REF`, `GITHUB_REF_NAME`, `CI_COMMIT_REF_NAME`, `GIT_BRANCH` | —          | Git branch tagged on each recording.                                                          |
| `commitSha`      | `string`   | `DIFFDECK_COMMIT`, `GITHUB_SHA`, `CI_COMMIT_SHA`, `GIT_COMMIT`                      | —                    | Git commit SHA tagged on each recording.                                                      |
| `stepCategories` | `string[]` | —                                                                                  | all categories       | If set, only steps with these Playwright categories are captured (e.g. `["test.step","expect"]`). |
| `quiet`          | `boolean`  | —                                                                                  | `false`              | Silence the reporter's console output.                                                        |
| `mode`           | `"upload" \| "write"` | `DIFFDECK_MODE`                                                          | `"upload"`           | `"upload"` (default) posts each recording during the run. `"write"` instead writes a metadata sidecar (see below). |

### Environment variables

The only thing CI must provide is the token (and usually the host):

```bash
export DIFFDECK_TOKEN="your-repo-project-token"
export DIFFDECK_HOST="https://diffdeck.ai"   # optional; this is the default
```

If no token is found, the reporter logs a one-time warning and uploads nothing — your test run is never failed by a missing token.

## What gets uploaded

For each completed test that has a video, the reporter sends a `multipart/form-data` request:

| Field        | Source                                              |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `video`      | the recorded video blob (`video/webm` or `video/mp4`) |
| `videoType`  | the video MIME type                                 |
| `testTitle`  | `test.title`                                        |
| `testFile`   | spec file, relative to the Playwright `rootDir`     |
| `testId`     | `test.id`                                            |
| `status`     | `passed` \| `failed` \| `timedOut` \| `skipped` \| `interrupted` |
| `durationMs` | `result.duration`                                   |
| `retries`    | `result.retry`                                      |
| `branch`     | resolved branch (see options)                       |
| `commitSha`  | resolved commit (see options)                       |
| `metadata`   | JSON string — the step-timeline document (below)    |

Authentication is the `X-UI-Review-Token` header.

If the repository does not have the DiffDeck recordings add-on enabled, the route responds `402`. The reporter treats this as a soft signal: it logs once and stops uploading for the rest of the run, without failing the test run.

## Deferred upload (`mode: "write"`)

By default the reporter **uploads during the run** — that's the recommended integration and needs no extra CI step. If you'd rather upload *after* the run (for example to keep the test job offline, or to batch the upload in a separate step), set `mode: "write"` (or `DIFFDECK_MODE=write`). Instead of uploading, the reporter writes a `<video>.json` metadata sidecar next to each recorded video, carrying the same fields it would have uploaded (test title, file, id, status, duration, retries, branch, commit, and the step timeline). No token is needed in write mode.

A later step then uploads them — e.g. the [`diffdeck` CLI / GitHub Action](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@diffdeckai/cli), which reads those sidecars so nothing has to be derived from file paths:

```yaml
- uses: diffdeck/diffdeck-action@v1
  with:
    command: recording
    token: ${{ secrets.DIFFDECK_TOKEN }}
    videos: test-results   # dir of videos + their .json sidecars
```

Most projects should stay on the default `"upload"` mode.

## Step-timeline metadata shape

The `metadata` field is a JSON document describing the per-step timeline. This is the data the DiffDeck player renders over the video. All step times are in **milliseconds relative to the start of the recording**, where the recording start equals the test's `startTime` (`recordingStartTime`).

```jsonc
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "reporter": "@diffdeckai/playwright-reporter",
  "reporterVersion": "0.1.0",
  "recordingStartTime": "2026-06-30T12:00:00.000Z", // ISO; timeline zero point
  "testDurationMs": 1500,
  "steps": [
    {
      "title": "sign in",            // step label
      "category": "test.step",       // test.step | expect | pw:api | hook | fixture | ...
      "startMs": 100,                // offset from recordingStartTime (>= 0)
      "endMs": 500,                  // offset from recordingStartTime (>= startMs)
      "durationMs": 400,             // endMs - startMs
      "depth": 0,                    // nesting depth (0 = top level)
      "location": "e2e/login.spec.ts:12:5", // optional source location
      "error": "locator.click: timeout"     // optional; present only on failed steps
    },
    {
      "title": "expect(page).toHaveURL(\"/dashboard\")",
      "category": "expect",
      "startMs": 300,
      "endMs": 350,
      "durationMs": 50,
      "depth": 1
    }
  ]
}
```

TypeScript types for this document are exported from the package:

```ts
import type { RecordingMetadata, RecordingStep } from "@diffdeckai/playwright-reporter";
import { RECORDING_METADATA_SCHEMA_VERSION } from "@diffdeckai/playwright-reporter";
```

### Notes on alignment

- `startMs`/`endMs` are computed from each step's `startTime` minus the test's `startTime`, then clamped to `>= 0`. The test start time is the best alignment to the video that Playwright exposes; sub-frame drift between the first painted frame and `startTime` is expected and small.
- Steps are ordered by `startMs` (ties keep capture order), and `depth` reflects nesting so a consumer can render the timeline hierarchically.
